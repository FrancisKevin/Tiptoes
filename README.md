# Tiptoes
A subclass of UINavigationController that will make the navigating process more silent and simple.

## Why You'd Want This 
You are tired of using system's own navigation controller and want to try something different.

## Transition Effect Customization 
Actually you can customize transition effect yourself.
However,the default transition effect of Tiptoes is fade-in-and-out:

## Usage
1. Drag the TiptoesNavController.swift to your project.
2. In the place of your setting navigationController's rootViewController code(normally in AppDelegate.swift), replace ```UINavigationController(rootViewController:xxx)```with```TiptoesNavController(rootViewController:xxx)```
3. Enjoy it!

( You can also git clone or download this repository directly, then open ```Tiptoes.xcodeproj```, run project and see the demo.)

## Contribute
As you can see, Tiptoes provide a thinking to customize navigation bar. But it is not perfect due to the limitation of author's time and energy. So I open up this repo to GitHub and I am looking forward that you guys can join me and make this repository more splendid.
